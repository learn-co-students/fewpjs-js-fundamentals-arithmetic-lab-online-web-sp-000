// Write your code here
// Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62.
// Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
// Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.
// Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20
