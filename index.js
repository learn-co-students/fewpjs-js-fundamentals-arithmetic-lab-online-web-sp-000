// Write your code here

// 1. Create a variable called multiply that will multiply the variables num1 and num2 whose results will equal "62".
const num1 = 2
const num2 = 31
var multiply = num1 * num2

// 2. Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1

// 3. Create a variable called mod set to an equation whose remainder is equal to "4".
var mod = 16 % 6

// 4. Create a variable called max that will return "20" as the highest number in the set.
var max = Math.max(5, 10, 15, 20)
